# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 using npm
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with resolved dependency tree

### 2. Code Changes
**Modified: `app/layout.tsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<ThemeProvider>` component
- The Analytics component is now included in the root layout, ensuring it's available across all pages

## Implementation Details

This is an App Router Next.js project (using the `app` directory structure), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `app/layout.tsx`. The component is placed inside the `<body>` tag after the main content, following Next.js best practices.

The placement ensures that:
- Analytics will track all pages in the application
- It won't interfere with the existing ThemeProvider functionality
- It follows the recommended pattern for App Router projects

## Verification

✅ **Build Check**: `npm run build` completed successfully with no errors
✅ **Lint Check**: The modified `app/layout.tsx` file passes all linting rules
✅ **Package Manager**: Used npm (project's existing package manager)
✅ **Lock Files**: package-lock.json updated and staged

## Files Modified

1. `app/layout.tsx` - Added Analytics import and component
2. `package.json` - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
3. `package-lock.json` - Updated with dependency resolution

All changes have been staged and are ready for commit.
